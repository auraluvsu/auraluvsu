## Hey there! I'm Nas 👋

🧑🏾‍💻 Backend Developer | 🇬🇧 based in London (but Canada always feels like home)

I’m an 18-year-old dev with a passion for building cool things, breaking into tech, and learning in training. Currently mastering backend development — mainly with **Go**, **Typescript**, **Zig** and **SQL** — while cooking up projects that help me stand out as a junior developer.
